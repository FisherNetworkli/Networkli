# Networkli Project Status

## Current Status Overview

We are currently progressing through **Phase 2** of our recommendation system implementation and have just completed the development of a swipe-based matching interface for better user engagement.

## Detailed Progress by Phase

### Phase 1: Data Foundation âœ… COMPLETED

- âœ… **User Profile Structure**: The profiles table in Supabase has been structured with all necessary fields for matching including:
  - Skills
  - Interests
  - Industry
  - Experience level
  - Location
  - Domain ID

- âœ… **Profile Edit Form**: The form has been updated to capture all relevant profile information.

- âœ… **Test Profiles**: We've created several test user profiles with realistic data to test our matching algorithms.

### Phase 2: Simple Implementation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

- âœ… **Attribute-matching Algorithm**: Implemented a simple algorithm that matches users based on:
  - Industry matches
  - Location proximity
  - Skill similarity
  - Interest overlap
  - Experience level compatibility

- âœ… **"Recommended" Section**: Added recommended connections in the network section of the dashboard.

- âœ… **Swipe Interface**: Implemented a mobile-friendly swipe interface for matching with other users.

- âœ… **Connect Feature**: Users can connect with recommended profiles directly through the UI.

- ðŸ”„ **User Engagement Monitoring**: Currently implementing comprehensive tracking of how users interact with recommendations.

### Phase 3: Data Collection & Refinement ðŸ”„ PARTIALLY STARTED

- âœ… **Track Recommendations**: Backend tracking of recommendation clicks is implemented.

- âœ… **Connection Tracking**: Recording of which recommendations lead to connection attempts.

- ðŸ”„ **Profile View Tracking**: Recording when users view profiles from recommendations.

- ðŸ•’ **Algorithm Refinement**: Pending more user data to refine matching weights.

### Phase 4: ML Integration ðŸ•’ PLANNED

- ðŸ•’ **GraphSAGE/MAML Implementation**: This will be implemented once we have sufficient user data.

- ðŸ•’ **A/B Testing**: Will run both implementations in parallel to compare effectiveness.

- ðŸ•’ **Performance Metrics**: Will establish metrics to measure success of different approaches.

## Current Challenges

1. **Database Connectivity**: We've experienced some connectivity issues with Supabase as noted in the logs:
   - Authentication errors with the API key
   - Circuit breaker pattern implemented to handle database outages
   - Currently operating in a degraded mode with fallback to mock data when DB is unavailable

2. **Data Sparsity**: Limited real user data makes algorithm refinement challenging.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Issues**:
   - Update Supabase credentials in the .env file
   - Verify service role API key permissions
   - Test API endpoints with correct authentication

2. **Complete Interaction Tracking**:
   - Fully implement logging of all user interactions with recommendations
   - Add more granular analytics endpoints for recommendation performance

3. **Enhance UI Experience**:
   - Polish the swipe matching interface
   - Add more detailed match reasons in the UI
   - Improve feedback mechanisms for recommendations

4. **Begin Data Analysis**:
   - Start analyzing initial user interactions
   - Identify patterns in successful connections
   - Prepare for algorithm refinement
